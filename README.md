This repository contains  C++ code for various algorithms used in Computer Graphics.


Computer graphics is a field of computer science that focuses on generating images and visual content using computers. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and applications, from simple 2D graphics to complex 3D modeling and animation. Here are some key aspects of computer graphics:

## 1.  2D Graphics

2D graphics involve creating images that have width and height but no depth. This includes:

* Vector Graphics: Images defined using geometric shapes like lines, curves, and polygons. They are resolution-independent, meaning they can be scaled without losing quality. Examples include SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files.

* Raster Graphics: Images made up of a grid of pixels, each with its own color value. Common formats include JPEG, PNG, and BMP. They are resolution-dependent, so scaling can lead to quality loss.

### 2. 3D Graphics

3D graphics add depth to images, creating a sense of volume and space. This includes:

* Modeling: The process of creating 3D objects using software. Models can be constructed using various techniques such as polygonal modeling, NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines), and digital sculpting.
* Rendering: Converting 3D models into 2D images or animations. This involves calculating lighting, shading, texture mapping, and more to create realistic or stylized images. Techniques include ray tracing, rasterization, and path tracing.
* Animation: Creating the illusion of movement by changing an objectâ€™s position, rotation, or shape over time. Keyframing and motion capture are common methods used in animation.
